# libft
The library containing basic and handy functions. The reproduction of some standard C libraries functions.

Compilation:

Type in the console:

- "make all" or "make" to compile the library.
- "make clean" to compile the library and delete *.o files used for compilation
- "make fclean" will delete *.o files and library compiled
- "make re" will recompile your files and library in full.

The result of the compilation shall be the file named "libft.a"

A few things to be added soon:

- A verified reproduction of printf function is to be implemented.
